# Tic Tac Toe
Basic Game using JavaScript and JQuery

Uses a table to create the board game.

Currently does the following:
- Tells you if a space has been selected
- Let's you restart the game (will clear the board)
- Will alert you when the game is over (meaning all the spaces on the board are filled)

Work in Progress:
- Tells you who's the winner (stop when it finds 3 in a row)
